## 📦 Installation

While the game can run directly from the `index.html` file, you may want to set up a local server for a better experience. Here’s how to do it using a simple HTTP server:

### Using Python (if you have Python installed)

- For Python 3.x:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server
  ```

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  ```

After running the command, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Tetris game ready to play.

### Using Node.js

If you prefer Node.js, you can use the `http-server` package:

1. Install `http-server` globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to start playing.
